Automatically apply a WooCommerce coupon when the cart subtotal exceeds a defined amount. Simple, lightweight, and effective!

== Description ==

**Auto Apply Coupon by Cart Total** is a lightweight WooCommerce extension that automatically applies a specific coupon code if the customer's cart subtotal exceeds a defined threshold.

Perfect for store owners who want to:
- Incentivize higher spending
- Automatically apply a discount at checkout
- Improve user experience with no coupon entry required

### Features:
- Auto-apply coupon based on cart total
- Simple settings: just enter coupon code and minimum cart amount
- Built for performance — no bloated features
- Works with all WooCommerce-compatible themes

### Use Case Example:
If you want to offer a $20 discount for orders over $200 — this plugin makes it happen automatically.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` or install via the WordPress Plugins menu.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.
3. Go to **WooCommerce > Settings > Auto Apply Coupon** (under the **Advanced** tab).
4. Enter the **coupon code** and **minimum cart total**.
5. Save changes. Done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin create a coupon for me? =
No. You need to create the coupon in **WooCommerce > Marketing > Coupons** first, then enter the code in the plugin settings.

= What happens if the cart total drops below the threshold? =
The coupon will be automatically removed.

= Can users still remove the coupon manually? =
Yes, but the plugin will respect their choice during that session and not re-apply it unless the cart total falls below the threshold and rises again.
